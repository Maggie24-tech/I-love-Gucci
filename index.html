      <h2>High-End Luxury Fashion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Gucci</strong> is an Italian high-end luxury fashion house based
        in Florence, Italy. Its product lines include handbags, ready-to-wear,
        footwear, accessories, and home decoration; and it licenses its name and
        branding to Coty, Inc. for fragrance and cosmetics under the name Gucci
        Beauty. Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci (1881 to 1953) in
        Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci (son of Guccio),
        Gucci became a worldwide-known brand, an icon of the Italian Dolce Vita.
